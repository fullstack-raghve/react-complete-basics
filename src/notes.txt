1>>> React (sometimes called React.js or ReactJS) is a 
JavaScript 
library for building a fast and interactive
 user interface. It was originated at Facebook 
 in 2011 and allow developers to create sizeable
  web applications or complex UIs by 
  integrating a small and isolated snippet of code.

 2>>> React.JS History
Current version of React.JS is V16.8.6 (March 2019).

Initial Release to the Public (V0.3.0) was in July 2013.

React.JS was first used in 2011 for Facebook's Newsfeed feature.

Facebook Software Engineer, Jordan Walke, created it.

The create-react-app version 2.0 package was released in October 2018.

Create-react-app version 2.0 supports Babel 7, webpack 4, and Jest23.

4>>Why React is so fast - JSX & Virtual DOM
What is JSX?
JSX stands for JavaScript XML.

JSX allows us to write HTML in React.

JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.

5>>In ReactJS, we have mainly two types of components.
 They are
 ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
a.Functional Components >> stateless component because 
they do not hold or manage state

In React, function components are a way to write 
components that only contain a render method and 
don't have their own state. They are simply JavaScript functions that may 
or may not receive data as parameters.
 We can create a function that takes 
 props(properties) as input and returns
  what should be rendered. 
  A valid functional component can be shown in the below example.

function WelcomeMessage(props) {  
  return <h1>Welcome to the , {props.name}</h1>;  
}  

Note - When creating a React component, the component's name must start with an upper case letter.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
b.Class Components

Class components are more complex than functional
 components. It requires you to extend from React.
  Component and create a render function which 
  returns a React element. You can pass data from
   one class to other class components. You can create
    a class by defining a class that extends Component 
    and has a render function. Valid class component 
    is shown in the below example.

    class MyComponent extends React.Component {  
  render() {  
    return (  
      <div>This is main component.</div>  
    );  
  }  
}
